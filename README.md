## "WHAT'S THE... !!?" / "MAIS QU'EST CE QUE... !!?" achievement

Hello again !

Now that you successfully earned the "knowledge is power" achievement, it's time to show me how clever you are ! As you may know (because you watched the source code previously), it's actually impossible to earn the "WHAT'S THE... !!?" achievement in the app. However, they is a way to trick the app, so that it will show that you earn the achievement.

I must warn you that this achievement can only "earn" with a rooted device (as far as I now).

Good luck (you gonna need it !), and have fun !

PS: Like the previous achievement, I offer you a beer if you manage to did it =)
